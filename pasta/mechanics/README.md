The production drawings of the components of the modules are stored in the respective folders under 'drawings'. Furthermore, there is the folder 'STEP', where a step file of the robot's assembly can be found, and the folder 'Object_Data', where an object file of the robot is stored. Content centre files are stored in the folder 'ContenCenter-Files'. This concerns all standard parts that are installed via the Content Centre. Other imported parts are stored in the respective subfolders for the corresponding assemblies. The file 'purchased_parts.xlsx' contains a list of our purchased parts.
